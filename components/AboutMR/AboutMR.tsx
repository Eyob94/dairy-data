						<p>
							Research has shown that farmers who milk record see clear benefits
							in animal health and economic performance
						</p>
						<p>
							On average, milk recording increases gross margin by â‚¬42 per cow,
							the milk yield by 406 litres per cow and reduces herd somatic cell
							count(SCC) by 38,860 cells/ml on average.
						</p>
						<p>
							In percentages, milk recording results in a significant
							improvement of
							<ul className="pl-8 list-disc">
								<li>4% in gross margins</li>
								<li>7% in milk yields</li>
								<li>25% reduction in SCC</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Therefore by achieving such beneficial gains you are improving the
							product quality, increasing your output while most importantly
							increasing gross margins on your farm.
